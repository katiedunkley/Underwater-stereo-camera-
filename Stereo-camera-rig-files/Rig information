# Stereo camera rig files

This folder contains the files needed to build the metal rig which holds the cameras. The folder contains:

1) PDFs showing the rig design and individual pieces (highlights measurements and drilling locations) 
2) A PDF for the aluminium plate. Two 3D printed holders are fixed to this plate and the camera is attached using jubilee clips. Each rig requires two plates.
3) A STL design file for 3D printing the tube holders.
